IT Scenario Generator
A Spring Boot REST API that generates realistic, random IT scenarios based on user inputs for technology, role, and environment.
It uses predefined datasets to create a challenge, incident, and troubleshooting step tailored to the inputs, making it useful for training, simulations, and role-based exercises.
 
Features
•	Accepts validated user inputs for:
o	Technology (e.g., Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, DevOps)
o	Role (e.g., System Administrator, Software Engineer, Security Analyst)
o	Environment (e.g., Enterprise Network, Cloud Infrastructure, On-Prem Data Center)
•	Randomly generates:
o	Challenge
o	Incident
o	Troubleshooting step
o	(Easily extendable with more scenario elements)
•	Input validation using Jakarta Bean Validation
•	Centralized global exception handling
•	TDD-style unit tests using JUnit 5
 
Tech Stack
•	Java 20
•	Spring Boot
•	REST API
•	JUnit 5 (Testing)
 
Installation

Flow Explanation:
1.	Client sends a POST request with technology, role, and environment.
2.	Controller receives and validates the request.
3.	Service checks datasets and randomly picks appropriate challenge, incident, and troubleshootingStep.
4.	Dataset & Logic ensures variety and realism in generated scenarios.
5.	Response is returned as JSON.
 
Testing
Run all unit tests:
bash
CopyEdit
mvn test
 
Error Handling
Example validation error response:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "technology": "Technology must not be blank"
}
 
TDD Approach
This project follows a Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology:
1.	Write failing unit tests for service logic and input validation.
2.	Implement functionality to pass the tests.
3.	Refactor and enhance code while keeping tests green.
 
Future Enhancements
•	Add more scenario categories (e.g., Security Breaches, Performance Tuning, Disaster Recovery)
•	Integrate with a database for dynamic data storage instead of hardcoded datasets
•	Add user authentication to save and track generated scenarios
•	Support multiple random scenarios per request
•	Create a frontend dashboard for interactive scenario generation
•	Export scenarios as PDF or CSV
•	Integrate AI models for more realistic, context-aware scenario generation
